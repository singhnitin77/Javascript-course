## Strict Mode

* ### Strict mode is a special mode that we can activate in JavaScript, which makes it easier for us to write a secure JavaScript code.
```Javascript
'use strict';
```

* ### This statement has to be the very first statement in the script.

* ### If we have any code before this then strict mode will not be activated.

* ### Comments are allowed because JavaScript will just ignore them but no code.

* ### We can also activate strict mode, only for a specific function or a specific block.

* ### Strict mode makes it easier for us developers to avoid accidental errors.

* ### It helps us introduce the bugs into our code and that's because of 2 reasons.

* ### First, strict mode forbids us to do certain things

* ### Second, it will actually create visible errors for us

* ### In certain situations in which without strict mode JavaScript will simply fail silently
