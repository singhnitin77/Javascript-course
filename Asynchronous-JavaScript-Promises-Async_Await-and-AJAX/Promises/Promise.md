Modern way of making AJAX calls & that is by using the Fetch API.

```Javascript
// const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
// request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`);
// request.send();

const request = fetch('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}');
console.log(request);
```

Call fetch with our URL.
The fetch function immediately returned a promise.

We immediately got the promise here.

We actually have a promise, so this promise is right now stored in request variable.

So the formal definition of a promise - placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.

we can also say that a promise is like a container for an asynchronously delivered value

A promise is a container for a future value.

So a container or a placeholder for a future value, and the perfect example of a future value is the response coming from an AJAX call.

So when we start the AJAX call, there is no value yet, but we know that there will be some value in the future.

And so we can use a promise to handle this future value.

## Advantage of using promises

By using promises, we no longer need to rely on events and callback functions to handle asynchronous results, events and callback functions can sometimes cause unpredictable results.

Instead of nesting callbacks, we can chain promises for a
sequence of asynchronous operations: escaping callback hell
instead of nesting like we did

Promises are an ES6 feature. So they became available in JavaScript in 2015.

## Promise Lifecycle

Since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time sensitive. So they change over time.

And so promises can be in different states and this is what they call the cycle of a promise.

So in the very beginning, we say that a promise is pending.

And so this is before any value resulting from the asynchronous task is available.

Now, during this time, the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background.

Then when the task finally finishes, we say that the promise is settled and there are two different types of settled promises and

That's fulfilled promises and rejected promises.

So a fulfilled promise is a promise that has

successfully resulted in a value just as we expect it.

For example, when we use the promise to fetch data from an API, a fulfilled promise successfully guts that data, and it's now available to being used.

On the other hand, a rejected promise means that there has been an error during the asynchronous task. And the example of fetching data from an API, an error would be for example, when the user is offline and can't connect to the API server.

Now these different states are very important to understand because when we use promises in our code,we will be able to handle these different states in order to do something as a result of either a successful promise or a rejected one.

Another important thing about promises is that a promise is only settled once.

So the promise was either fulfilled or rejected, but it's impossible to change that state.

---

---

# Consuming Promises

```Javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)

};
```

Calling the fetch function like this, will then immediately return a promise.

Aas soon as we start the request and in the beginning,this promise is still pending because the asynchronous task of getting the data, is still running in the background.
at a certain point the promise will then be settled and either in a fulfilled or in a rejected state, but for now let's assume success

So assume that the promise will be fulfilled and that we have a value available to work with And so to handle this fulfilled state, we can use the then method on all promises, we can call the then method.

```Javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
       fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
         .then(function (response) {
           console.log(response);
         })
    });
};
```

Now into the then method, we need to pass a callback function that we want to be executed as soon as the promise is actually fulfilled.

So as soon as the result is available, a function and then this function will actually receive one argument once it's called by JavaScript and that argument is the resulting value of the fulfilled promise.

In order to be able to actually read this data from the body, we need to call the json method on the response.
json is a method that is available on all responses of the fetch method.

```Javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
       fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
         .then(function (response) {
           console.log(response);
            return response.json();
         })
          .then(function (data) {
            console.log(data);
       renderCountry(data[0]);
     });
};
getCountryData('portugal')
```

The problem here is that this json function itself, is actually also an asynchronous function.
It will also return a new promise. return this promise from here.

Here will be a new promise, now we need to handle that promise as well and so the way we do that is to then call another then So we need another callback function

---

---

### Chaining Promises

2nd AJAX call depends on the data from the first call, so it needs to be done in sequence.

As soon as we get the data, we need to get the neighbour country and do AJAX call for that one as well.

Then method always returns a promise no matter if we actually return anything or not.

But we return a value, then that value will become a fulfillment value of the return promise.

```javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  // Country 1
  fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      renderCountry(data[0]);
      const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];

      if (!neighbour) return;

      // Country 2
      return fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${neighbour}`);
      // return 23;
    })
    // .then(data => alert(23));
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => renderCountry(data, "neighbour"));
};
getCountryData("portugal");
```

Here without callback hell we have a flat chain of promises, very easy to understand and read.

Promises are incredibly powerful and elegant solution to handle asynchronous code.

We should chain then method directly to a new nested promise.

---

---

### Handling rejected promises

The only way in which fetch promises are rejected is when the user loses it's internet connection.

For the 1st time the promise that's returned from the fetch function was actually rejected.

There are two ways of handling rejections.

1. Pass a callback function into then method - first callback function is gonna be called for fulfilled promise so for a successful one.

2nd callback function will be called for rejected promise

Handling the error also called catching the error.

```javascript
fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then(
  (response) => response.json(),
  (err) => alert(err)
);
```

What if there was actually no error in 1st fetch promise, but the 2nd one was rejected then we have to catch error there also.

```javascript
.then((response) => response.json(),
err => alert(err)
)
    .then((data) => renderCountry(data, "neighbour"));
```

There is better way to handle errors globally, in the end by adding a catch method

```javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  // Country 1
  fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
    .then(
      (response) => response.json(),
      (err) => alert(err)
    )
    .then((data) => {
      renderCountry(data[0]);
      const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];

      if (!neighbour) return;

      // Country 2
      return fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${neighbour}`);
      // return 23;
    })
    // .then(data => alert(23));
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => renderCountry(data, "neighbour"))
    // .catch(err => alert(err))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥`);
      renderError(`Something went wrong ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ ${err.message}. Try again!`);
    });
};
```

Catch method at the end of the chain will catch any error that occurs in any place in the whole promise chain.

Errors basically propagate down the chain until they are caught.

```javascript
const renderError = function (msg) {
  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentText("beforeend", msg);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};
```

Function that will also render some kind of error message

```javascript
.finally(()=> {
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
})
};
```

finally method will always be called whatever happens with the promise no matter if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

This Callback function Gonna be called always

### Throws Errors Manually

```javascript
getCountryData("sddsfdsf");
```

During the fetch there was a 404 error, the fetch function still didn't reject in this case. Many people, and that includes myself think that in this case, the promise should actually be rejected right away,

But again, it just doesn't, and so we will have to do it manually.

```javascript
fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);
  return response.json();
});
```

We create a new error using a constructor function basically and we pass in a message, which is error message. then we use the throw keyword here, which will immediately terminate the current function just like return does it.

The effect of creating, and throwing an error in any of these then methods is that the promise will immediately reject.

The promise returned by this then handler here will be a rejected promise. And that rejection will then propagate all the way down to the catch handler, which we already have set up here.

Handling these errors is the only way in which we can actually display an error message like this on the screen for the user,

It's just a really bad practice to leave these rejected promises, hanging around without handling them.

---

### Asynchronous Behind the Scenes - The Event Loop

---

### Event Loop in Practise

```javascript
console.log("Test started");
setTimeout(() => console.log("0 sec timer"), 0);
// After 0 sec, this callback will be put in the callback queue.

Promise.resolve("Resolved promise 1").then((res) => console.log(res));
console.log("Test end");
```

Promise that resolves immediately. Promise.resolve() allows us to create a promise that is immediately resolved, one that immediately has success value.

The timer appears first in the code and so it kind of finished first.

And so it's callback, will be put on the callback queue first, but does that mean that this call back here will be executed first ?

Well, actually, no, it doesn't. And that's because of the micro-tasks queue, remember?

So the callback of the resolved promise here, So this one will be put on the micro-tasks queue and this micro-tasks queue, priority over the callback queue.

And so after this whole code runs, we will have one callback in a callback queue and one in a micro-tasks queue.

And therefore the one from the micro tests queue should be executed first.

And so therefore the callback from the micro-tasks queue should be executed first.

And so that's this one here and there for the first message to appear of these two, should be resolved Promise one.

Remember that the implication of the fact that micro-tasks have priority over regular callbacks, is that if one of the micro-tasks takes a long time to run, then the timer will actually be delayed and not run after the zero seconds that we specified here, right?

So instead it will run a little bit later just after the micro-task is actually done with its work.

---

```javascript
console.log("Test started");
setTimeout(() => console.log("0 sec timer"), 0);

Promise.resolve("Resolved promise 1").then((res) => console.log(res));
Promise.resolve("Resolved promise 2").then((res) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {}
  console.log(res);
});

console.log("Test end");
```

We you cannot really do high precision things using JavaScript timers.

So just keep that in mind, whenever you are working with promises. So basically with micro-tasks, and with timers at the same time.

---

---

### BUILDING A SIMPLE PROMISE

```javascript
const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
    resolve("You WIN");
  } else {
    reject("You lost your money");
  }
});

lotteryPromise.then((res) => console.log(res)).catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

In this example, a fulfilled promise means to win the lottery while a rejected promise means to lose.

Create a new promise using the promise constructor.

This means is that promises are essentially just a special kind of object in JavaScript.

Now the promise constructor takes exactly one argument and that is the so-called executor function. So we need to pass in a function here. And so again, this one is called executor.

Now, as soon as the promise constructor runs, it will automatically execute this executor function that we pass in. And as it executes this function here, it will do so by passing in two other arguments. And those arguments are the resolve and reject functions.

All of this here we'll create a new promise that we're gonna store into this variable. So it's just like, for example, the fetch function, which also creates a new promise.

Now this executor function that we specified here is the function which will contain the asynchronous behavior that we're trying to handle with the promise.

Executor function should eventually produce a result value. the value that's basically gonna be the future value of the promise.

Into the resolved function here we pass the fulfilled value of the promise so that it can later be consumed with the den method.

So of course we are going to handle the results of this promise just like we handled any other promise with the then method.

whatever value we pass into the resolve function here is gonna be the result of the promise that will be available in the then handler.

So just to quickly recap, before we consume this promise here, we created an executor function which is gonna be called by this promise constructor as soon as it runs, so basically immediately.

Then the promise calls this function and passes in the resolve and the reject functions so that we can then use them to mark the promise as either resolved so as fulfilled or as to rejected.

This promise is eventually going to move to either the fulfilled state or the rejected state.

We always need to make sure that the promise ends up in one of these two states.

```javascript
const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  console.log("Lottery draw is happening ðŸ”®");
  setTimeout(function () {
    if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
      resolve("You WIN ðŸ’°");
    } else {
      reject(new Error("You lost your money ðŸ’©"));
    }
  }, 2000);
});

lotteryPromise
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

Let's actually simulate this lottery draw by adding a simple timer. And so this timer will then simulate the time data is passed between buying the lottery ticket and actually getting the result.

We did actually encapsulate some asynchronous behavior into this promise. that's the whole point of promises in the first place.

Now, in practice, most of the time all we actually do is to consume promises.

And we usually only built promises to basically wrap old callback based functions into promises.

And this is a process that we call promisifying.

So basically promisifying means to convert callback based asynchronous behavior to promise based.

---

```javascript
// Promisifying setTimeout
const wait = function (seconds) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

wait(1)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("1 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("2 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("3 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => console.log("4 second passed"));
```

Promisify the set timeout function and create a wait function.

Let's create a function called wait and this function is going to take in a number of seconds.

And so now inside of this function we will actually create and return the promise.

That's always what we do. So creating a function and then from there returning a promise.

And so this will then encapsulate the asynchronous operation even further.

So essentially that's also what the fetch function does. It's a function that returns a promise, and so that is exactly what we will do here with this wait function. So in a sense this here is a more real world example. So promisifying set timeout.

In this case, we actually don't even need the reject function.

And that's because it's actually impossible for the timer to fail. And so therefore, We will never mark this promise as rejected.

And so here we don't even need to specify debt reject parameter.

It's just like the array methods like map which always receive three arguments but most of the time we just use one or two of them.

```javascript
// setTimeout(() => {
//   console.log('1 second passed');
//   setTimeout(() => {
//     console.log('2 seconds passed');
//     setTimeout(() => {
//       console.log('3 second passed');
//       setTimeout(() => {
//         console.log('4 second passed');
//       }, 1000);
//     }, 1000);
//   }, 1000);
// }, 1000);

Promise.resolve("abc").then((x) => console.log(x));
Promise.reject(new Error("Problem!")).catch((x) => console.error(x));
```

---

### CONSUMING PROMISES WITH ASYNC / AWAIT

```javascript
const whereAmI = async function (country) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`);
  console.log(res);
};

whereAmI("portugal");
console.log("FIRST");
```

Async - Function that will basically keep running in the background while performing the code that inside of it. When the function is done, it automatically returns a promise.

Inside async function, we can have one or more await statements.

We can use the await keyword to await for the result of the promise.

Await will stop the code execution at this point of the function until the promise is fulfilled, until the data has been fetched.

We might think isn't stopping the code, blocking the execution?

The answer is actually no, in this case, because stopping execution in an async function, which is what we have here is actually not a problem because this function is running asynchronously in the background. And so therefore it is not blocking the main threat of execution.

So it's not blocking the call stack. And in fact, that's, what's so special about a single wait.

So it's the fact that it makes our code look like regular synchronous code while behind the scenes. Everything is in fact asynchronous.

As soon as this premise here is resolved, then the value of this whole await expression that we have here is going to be the resolved value of the premise. And so we can simply store that into a variable.

We see here that by using async await or asynchronous code here, really looks and feels like synchronous code.

We can simply await until the value of the premise is returned basically. And then just assign that value to a variable meant that is something that was impossible before.

Before we had to mess with callback functions and dead was true in callback hell, but also by consuming premises with the then method. But now with a sync await, that is just completely gone, this looks now like normal synchronous code where we simply assign values to a variable, and that makes it so much easier and more clean.

We need to first understand that async await is in fact, simply syntactic sugar over the then method in premises. So of course behind the scenes, we are still using promises.

We are simply using a different way of consuming them here in this case, but what we have here.

So this is essentially exactly the same as doing it the old way.
Using then and then res and then console dot log res like we did here.

```javascript
const getPosition = function () {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
  });
};

// fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then(res => console.log(res))

const whereAmI = async function () {
  // Geolocation
  const pos = await getPosition();
  const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;

  // Reverse geocoding
  const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`);
  const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();
  console.log(dataGeo);

  // Country data

  const res = await fetch(
    `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${dataGeo.country}`
  );
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
  renderCountry(data[0]);
};
whereAmI();
console.log("FIRST");
```

We are awaiting 5 promises here, in a very easy way. Code that actually looks and feels like normal synchronous code.

### ERROR HANDLING WITH TRY / CATCH

With a async/await, we can't use the catch method that we use before, because we can really attach it anywhere. So instead, we use try catch statement.

The try catch statement is actually used in regular JavaScript as well, So try catch has nothing to do with a sinc/await. But we can still use it to catch errors in async functions.

```javascript
// try {
//   let y = 1;
//   const x = 2;
//   x = 3;
// } catch(err) {
//   alert(err.message);
// }

// Now the error is no longer in the console.
```

```javascript
// fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then(res => console.log(res))

const whereAmI = async function () {
  try {
    // Geolocation
    const pos = await getPosition();
    const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;
    // Reverse geocoding
    const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`);
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting location data");
    const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();
    console.log(dataGeo);
    // Country data
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${dataGeo.country}`
    );

    // BUG in video:
    // if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error('Problem getting country');

    // FIX:
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting country");
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log(data);
    renderCountry(data[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥`);
    renderError(`ðŸ’¥ ${err.message}`);
  }
};
whereAmI();
whereAmI();
whereAmI();
console.log("FIRST");
```

The fetch promise does not reject on a 404 error, or on a 403 error.

---

### RETURNING VALUES FROM ASYNC FUNCTIONS

```javascript
console.log("1: Will get location");
whereAmI();
console.log("2: Finished getting location");

// Output Order
// 1: Will get location
// 2: Finished getting location
// whereAmI()
```

We get the first log then the second one and of course only after that we get all the logs coming from the async function.

So again, that's because this is an async function that runs in the background. So JavaScript immediately moves on to the next line here.

Now, if this was indeed a regular function and there would be a console.log in that regular function, then of course, that would appear here between one and two.

---

```javascript
const whereAmI = async function () {
  try {
    // Geolocation
    const pos = await getPosition();
    const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;
    // Reverse geocoding
    const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`);
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting location data");
    const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();
    // Country data
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${dataGeo.country}`
    );
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting country");
    const data = await res.json();
    renderCountry(data[0]);

    return `You are in ${dataGeo.city}, ${dataGeo.country}`;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥`);
    renderError(`ðŸ’¥ ${err.message}`);
  }
};

console.log("1: Will get location");
const city = whereAmI(); // Promise {<pending>}
console.log(city);
console.log("3: Finished getting location");
```

An async function always returns a promise, it actually makes sense that here we get a promise and not the value that we would like to get.

So the string here, `You are in ${dataGeo.city}, ${dataGeo.country}`

The reason for that is that at this point of the code, JavaScript has simply no way of knowing yet there's a string here that we want because the function is still running, but it is also not blocking the code out here. And so therefore again, at this point, JavaScript has no way of knowing what will be returned from this function.

And so therefore all that this function does return is a promise. Now the value that we return from an async function, so again, that's this string here will become the fulfilled value of the promise that is returned by the function.

And so that's important to understand. So again, this promise that we see down here, the fulfilled value of that promise is going to be this string here, because that is the value that we return from the async function while at least if there is no error here happening in the function.

---

```javascript
const whereAmI = async function () {
  try {
    // Geolocation
    const pos = await getPosition();
    const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;
    // Reverse geocoding
    const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`);
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting location data");
    const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();
    // Country data
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${dataGeo.country}`
    );
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting country");
    const data = await res.json();
    renderCountry(data[0]);

    return `You are in ${dataGeo.city}, ${dataGeo.country}`;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥`);
    renderError(`ðŸ’¥ ${err.message}`);
  }
};

console.log("1: Will get location");
// const city = whereAmI();
// console.log(city);
whereAmI().then((city) => console.log(city));
console.log("3: Finished getting location");
```

then method to get the fulfilled value of the promise.

---

Let's think about errors

```javascript
const whereAmI = async function () {
  try {
    // Geolocation
    const pos = await getPosition();
    const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;
    // Reverse geocoding
    const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`);
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting location data");
    const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();
    // Country data
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${dataGeo.country}`
    );
    if (!resGeo.ok) throw new Error("Problem getting country");
    const data = await res.json();
    renderCountry(data[0]);

    return `You are in ${dataGeo.city}, ${dataGeo.country}`;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err} ðŸ’¥`);
    renderError(`ðŸ’¥ ${err.message}`);

    // Reject promise returned from async function
    throw err;
  }
};

console.log("1: Will get location");
// const city = whereAmI();
// console.log(city);

whereAmI()
  .then(city => console.log(`2: ${city}`));
  .catch(err => console.error(`2: ${err.message}`))
  .finally(() => console.log("3: Finished getting location"))

console.log("3: Finished getting location");
```

```javascript
console.log("1: Will get location");
// const city = whereAmI();
// console.log(city);

whereAmI()
  .then(city => console.log(`2: ${city}`));
  .catch(err => console.error(`2: ${err.message}`))
  .finally(() => console.log("3: Finished getting location"))

/*
There's still a problem here. And that problem is the fact that doing this here kind of makes this the philosophy of async/await with handling promises using then and catch, So we are mixing the old and the new way of working with promises here, all in the same code.
*/

Convert this to async/await as well.

We can treat the promise here that has returned just like any other promise. And so of course we are able to handle it using async/await.

It would be great if we could simply use await without the async function, but that doesn't really work, at least for now, because there is actually a proposal in the works to make this happen, but for now, await can only be used inside an async function.

IIFE

```javascript
(async function () {
  try {
    const city = await whereAmI();
    console.log(`2: ${city}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`2: ${err.message} ðŸ’¥`);
  }
  console.log("3: Finished getting location");
})();
```
